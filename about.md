This blog is about coding and devops topics. Some of them might have some value to others. Some are just cool. I try to explain my thoughts as good as I can. So enjoy.

Since I live in the `.NET` world you can mostly expect topics that are dealing with our every day's `.NET` issues.

To be honest, you should not expect a high frequency here. I'm not that _blog every free minute_ guy.
